This directory contains various files and folders essential for the project's data analysis and web application components:

1. Analyzing Datasets Notebook: This Jupyter notebook, titled 'Analyzing Datasets,' is dedicated to the descriptive statistical analysis of the datasets compiled for this project. It's used to gain insights and understand the underlying patterns within the data.

2. Model Development Notebook: The 'Model Development' Jupyter notebook is where the machine learning model is constructed. The notebook guides you through the model's training process that will be implemented for predictive analytics.

3. skilvul-submission Folder: This folder is designed to facilitate local deployment of the web application. If you are using XAMPP, place this folder within the 'htdocs' directory to serve the application through your local server.

Within the 'skilvul-submission' directory, there are two SQL tables intended for integration with the MySQL database under the schema named 'skilvul'. Once these tables are imported into the database, navigate to 'home.php' to interact with the web-based application.

Each component plays a critical role in the workflow of the project, from data analysis to the practical application of the predictive model within a user-friendly web interface.
